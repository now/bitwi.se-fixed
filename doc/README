Bitwi.se’s Fixed Font README
============================

Introduction
------------

Bitwi.se’s Fixed font is an extensive modification of Markus Kuhn’s extension
of -misc-fixed-*-iso8859-1 fonts for X11.  The differences include rounder
characters, an easier-to-spot zero, cleaned-up accents, redone arrows, and
more.  The main design principle for this font was ot make it more pleasant to
read on-screen, as it was felt that -misc-fixed-* is far to pointy and stiff.
This font only comes in one size, 6 by 13, as that’s the default size for the
-misc-fixed-* family of fonts and also the best for most screens.  Other sizes
can be made, but volunteers are desperately wanted for such an untertaking.

Not much news.  The font is more or less complete.  Still, characters may change
as I spot discrepancies.
